# Hezalli Delivery Points — design & build plan

Partner-operated parcel hubs ("Hezalli Points"): a local shop owner registers
as a **delivery point**, sellers drop packed parcels there, Hezalli Express
couriers collect assigned parcels from the point via QR handover, and failed
deliveries flow back through the point for reschedule or return-to-seller.
The point operator earns a per-parcel handling fee — they are partners, not
staff.

This is the agent/drop-off-point model used by SPX (Shopee), J&T partner
points, and Amazon Hub — adapted to a single-hop network (no inter-city line
haul yet): one point serves as both drop-off and last-mile station.

## 1. Parcel lifecycle (target design)

```
Seller "Ship" via Hezalli Express, picks a Point
        ↓  Shipment: LABEL_CREATED  (awaiting drop-off, custody: seller)
Seller brings parcel → point staff SCAN parcel QR      [receive]
        ↓  Shipment: AT_POINT       (custody: point) → courier auto-assigned
Driver arrives → staff scans DRIVER QR → driver manifest shown
Staff/driver SCAN each parcel QR                       [handover]
        ↓  Shipment: OUT_FOR_DELIVERY (custody: driver, buyer notified)
   ├─ Delivered (optional buyer QR / delivery-code verify)
   │      ↓  DELIVERED — COD ledger, point handling fee credited
   └─ Failed (reason recorded, parcel stays with driver)
          ↓  Shipment: FAILED
      Driver returns to point → staff SCAN parcel      [return]
          ↓  Shipment: RETURNED_TO_POINT (custody: point, buyer notified)
       ├─ Buyer reschedules (picks day + note) → handover again → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
       └─ Attempt limit reached / buyer refused → point marks RTS
              ↓  Shipment: RETURNED — seller notified to collect
```

Chain-of-custody rule: **every handover is a scan** (seller→point,
point→driver, driver→buyer, driver→point, point→seller). At any moment
exactly one party is accountable for the parcel.

Direct courier flow (no point) is unchanged — a point is an optional route
chosen by the seller at ship time.

## 2. Data model

New models / enum changes in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

| Change | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Role.DELIVERY_POINT` | Point operator role (granted on application approval). |
| `DeliveryPoint` | The hub: owner user, name, phone, governorate, city, address line, optional lat/lng, `status` (ACTIVE/SUSPENDED). One per owner. |
| `DeliveryPointApplication` | "Become a point" application, mirrors `CourierApplication` (PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED, resubmit reuses row). |
| `DeliveryPointLedgerEntry` | Signed ledger: `HANDLING_FEE` (+, per delivered parcel), `PAYOUT` (−, admin pays the point), `ADJUSTMENT` (±). |
| `Shipment.deliveryPointId` | Route: which point the parcel goes through (null = direct). |
| `Shipment.deliveryCode` | Short random code for optional buyer-QR proof of delivery. |
| `Shipment.redeliverAt` / `redeliverNote` | Buyer's requested redelivery day + note after a failed attempt. |
| `ShipmentStatus.AT_POINT` | Parcel received & held at the point. |
| `ShipmentStatus.RETURNED_TO_POINT` | Failed parcel scanned back into the point. |
| `DeliveryAttempt.codeVerified` | DELIVERED attempt was confirmed via the buyer's delivery code/QR. |

New platform settings (`lib/settings.ts` defaults):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `points_enabled` | `true` | Master switch for routing via points. |
| `point_handling_fee` | `0.5` | USD credited to the point per **delivered** parcel routed through it. |
| `max_delivery_attempts` | `3` | Failed attempts after which the point should return the parcel to the seller. |

## 3. QR codes (three of them)

1. **Parcel QR** — already exists (shipping label encodes the tracking URL);
   all point scans resolve a parcel by tracking token, same as the driver app.
2. **Driver collection QR** — driver app shows a QR encoding
   `hezalli:driver:<courierId>`; point staff scan it to open that driver's
   manifest (their assigned parcels held at this point).
3. **Buyer delivery QR** — order page shows a QR of the shipment's
   `deliveryCode` while out for delivery; the driver can scan/enter it at the
   doorstep for verified proof of delivery. **Optional** — delivery works
   without it (photo/recipient-name proof unchanged).

## 4. Custody & money rules

- Fees: the point earns `point_handling_fee` only when a routed parcel
  reaches DELIVERED (recorded inside the shared delivery transaction in
  `lib/shipment-core.ts`, the single money path).
- COD stays on the courier ledger exactly as today (driver collects, driver
  remits to Hezalli). Points do not touch cash in v1.
- Liability by custody: lost while `AT_POINT`/`RETURNED_TO_POINT` → point;
  lost while `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`/`FAILED` → driver. The scan trail is the
  evidence; admins settle via ledger `ADJUSTMENT`s.
- RTS (`RETURNED`) leaves the sub-order for ops to resolve with existing
  cancel/refund tools in v1 (no automatic refund).

## 5. Build phases & checklist

### Phase 1 — Schema & settings
- [x] Prisma models: `DeliveryPoint`, `DeliveryPointApplication`, `DeliveryPointLedgerEntry` + enums (`DeliveryPointStatus`, `PointLedgerType`), `Role.DELIVERY_POINT`
- [x] `Shipment` additions: `deliveryPointId`, `deliveryCode`, `redeliverAt`, `redeliverNote`; `DeliveryAttempt.codeVerified`
- [x] `ShipmentStatus` + `AT_POINT`, `RETURNED_TO_POINT`
- [x] Migration SQL (`prisma/migrations/.../delivery_points`)
- [x] Settings defaults: `points_enabled`, `point_handling_fee`, `max_delivery_attempts`

### Phase 2 — Core libs
- [x] `lib/authz.ts`: `requireDeliveryPoint()` (active owner of an ACTIVE point)
- [x] `lib/point-core.ts`: receive / handover / return-to-point / return-to-seller transitions (scan-driven, event-logged, race-guarded)
- [x] `lib/point-ledger.ts`: fee accrual, balance summary (mirrors courier ledger)
- [x] `lib/shipment-core.ts`: credit point handling fee on DELIVERED; record `codeVerified` proof
- [x] Ship flow: `shipSubOrder` accepts optional `deliveryPointId` (platform-managed only) → `LABEL_CREATED`, auto-assign deferred to point receive; `deliveryCode` minted for platform-managed parcels

### Phase 3 — Server actions
- [x] `lib/actions/point-application.ts`: apply + admin review (approve grants role & creates point)
- [x] `lib/actions/point.ts`: `pointReceiveParcel`, `pointHandoverParcel`, `pointReceiveReturn`, `pointReturnToSeller` (all by tracking token)
- [x] `lib/actions/point-ledger.ts` (admin): payout + adjustment
- [x] Buyer: `requestRedelivery(subOrderId, date, note)` (only while FAILED / RETURNED_TO_POINT)
- [x] Driver: delivery-code verification wired into `courierAdvance` DELIVERED proof

### Phase 4 — Point operator app (`/point`)
- [x] Layout + tab bar (Parcels · Scan · Ledger), role-guarded like `/driver`
- [x] Dashboard: parcels grouped by state (awaiting drop-off, at point, out with drivers, returned) + redelivery dates
- [x] Scan page: camera QR scanner with mode picker (Receive / Handover / Return) + manual tracking entry; handover mode accepts a driver-QR scan to filter the manifest
- [x] Ledger page: balance + entries

### Phase 5 — Driver / seller / buyer touchpoints
- [x] Driver page: "My collection QR" card; job page shows pickup point; delivered dialog gets optional delivery-code field
- [x] Seller ship dialog: optional point selector (active points, platform carrier only)
- [x] Buyer order page: delivery QR + code while out for delivery; reschedule form after a failed attempt
- [x] Public tracking timeline: labels for the two new statuses

### Phase 6 — Admin
- [x] `/admin/points`: list points (status toggle), review applications, ledger with payout/adjustment recording
- [x] Settings page: the three new keys editable

### Phase 7 — i18n, tests, docs
- [x] `messages/en.json` + `messages/ar.json`: `Point`, `AdminPoints` namespaces + Driver/Orders/SellerOrders additions
- [x] Integration tests: application approval, receive→handover→deliver (fee ledger), fail→return→reschedule→re-handover, RTS after max attempts, authz guards
- [x] `docs/EXPRESS-DELIVERY.md` cross-link + this file kept current

## 6. v1.1 — Buyer pickup from point (PUDO)

The buyer chooses **"collect from a Hezalli Point"** at checkout instead of
home delivery: the seller drops the parcel at the buyer's chosen point, the
buyer is notified when it's ready, shows their delivery QR/code at the
counter, pays COD cash there, and the point marks it delivered. No courier is
involved at all — failed doorstep attempts disappear for these orders, and
the point still earns its handling fee. This pulls in **point cash handling**
(the counter collects COD), so the point ledger is split into an earnings
side and a cash side, mirroring the courier ledger.

```
Checkout: buyer picks PICKUP for a store group + ONE point for the order
        ↓  SubOrder.shippingMethod = PICKUP, SubOrder.pickupPointId set
Seller "Ship" (platform carrier) → route FORCED to the buyer's point
        ↓  LABEL_CREATED → point receives [scan] → AT_POINT
Buyer notified "ready for pickup — bring your code"   (no courier assigned)
        ↓
Point scans buyer's delivery QR (or types the code)   [pickup]
        ↓  code must match → DELIVERED (codeVerified proof)
COD cash → point ledger COD_COLLECTED · handling fee credited as usual
Point remits cash to Hezalli → admin records COD_REMITTANCE
```

Rules: pickup is free for the buyer by default (`pickup_fee` setting);
driver handover and doorstep-fail actions are blocked for PICKUP parcels;
the pickup scan requires the buyer's code — it is the proof of handover.

### Build checklist (v1.1)

#### Phase A — Schema, settings & quotes
- [x] `ShippingMethod.PICKUP`, `SubOrder.pickupPointId`, `PointLedgerType.COD_COLLECTED` / `COD_REMITTANCE` + migration
- [x] Settings: `pickup_fee` (USD, default 0) editable in Admin → Settings
- [x] `lib/shipping.ts`: `pickup` option (when points enabled + an active point exists) + `resolveShippingChoice` support

#### Phase B — Order & custody flow
- [x] `placeOrder`: accepts `PICKUP` per store + one `pickupPointId` per order (validated ACTIVE)
- [x] `shipSubOrder`: PICKUP sub-orders route to the buyer's point automatically (platform carrier required)
- [x] `point-core`: receive → "ready for pickup" notice, no courier auto-assign; handover/RTS scans reject PICKUP parcels
- [x] `pointBuyerPickup(code)`: resolve by delivery code, deliver with `codeVerified` proof, COD cash → `COD_COLLECTED`
- [x] `point-ledger`: summary split (earnings vs cash-on-hand); admin `remittance` kind on the payout action

#### Phase C — UI
- [x] Checkout: PICKUP option per store group + one point picker for the order
- [x] Point app: "Pickup" scan mode (buyer QR/code) showing the COD amount to collect; dashboard pickup badge; ledger page cash tiles
- [x] Admin points: cash-on-hand column + remittance recording; settings field for `pickup_fee`
- [x] Buyer order page: "collect from {point}" card with address + code; seller ship form shows the forced destination

#### Phase D — i18n, tests, docs
- [x] en + ar keys for all of the above
- [x] Integration tests: pickup quote/choice, forced routing, ready-notify without auto-assign, code-gated pickup + COD cash + fee ledgers, handover/fail blocked
- [x] This file kept current

## 7. Out of scope

## 8. v1.2 — Point capacity & smart selection

Keeps small shops from being buried in parcels and puts the *right* point
first in every picker. Each point gets an optional **capacity** (max parcels
held at once; empty = unlimited). Capacity gates **new routing only** — a
parcel already announced to a point is always accepted at the counter, so a
scan at the desk never bounces; ops fix overload by raising capacity or
suspending the point.

Rules:

- **Load** = parcels currently held or inbound (`LABEL_CREATED`, `AT_POINT`,
  `RETURNED_TO_POINT`) on in-flight sub-orders.
- A point is **full** when load ≥ capacity. Full points disappear from the
  checkout picker and the seller drop-off picker, and `placeOrder` /
  `shipSubOrder` re-validate server-side (client lists are never trusted).
- **Ordering**: pickers list points in the buyer's destination governorate
  first, least-loaded first within a governorate (the checkout picker
  re-sorts live when the buyer switches address).
- Admins set capacity on the point detail page; the operator sees their own
  load vs capacity on the dashboard.

### Build checklist (v1.2)

- [x] Schema: `DeliveryPoint.capacity Int?` + migration
- [x] `lib/point-select.ts`: load counting, full-point filtering, governorate-first ordering (shared by checkout, seller page, validation)
- [x] `placeOrder` + `shipSubOrder`: reject routing to a full point (`pointFull`); forced PICKUP routes stay valid
- [x] Checkout picker: nearest-first per selected address, full points excluded
- [x] Seller drop-off picker: same ordering by the order's destination
- [x] Admin point detail: capacity editor; network list shows load/capacity
- [x] Point dashboard: load vs capacity header
- [x] i18n (en + ar) + integration tests (full-point rejection, ordering, unlimited default, forced-pickup exemption)
- [x] This file kept current

## 10. v1.3 — Automatic resolution & refunds on RTS

Until now a return-to-seller left the sub-order stuck at SHIPPED for ops to
untangle. Now the RTS scan settles everything in one step, through the same
shared refund core (`lib/refunds.ts`) the admin and returns flows use:

- **Prepaid & captured** (non-COD payment CONFIRMED): full refund credited to
  the buyer's HezalliPay wallet, sub-order → REFUNDED, seller ledger
  reversed, buyer notified — all via `applyRefund`.
- **Nothing captured** (COD, or prepaid not yet confirmed): sub-order →
  CANCELLED with an order-history entry and a buyer notice; no money moves.
- **Both paths restock** the returned items (the goods are back with the
  seller) and keep the seller's collect-from-point notification.

### Build checklist (v1.3)

- [x] `lib/point-core.ts`: `returnParcelToSeller` resolves the sub-order (refund via `applyRefund` / cancel), restocks items, records order history
- [x] Buyer notified of the outcome (refund notice comes from the refund core; cancel path sends its own)
- [x] i18n (en + ar) for the cancel notice
- [x] Integration tests: COD RTS → CANCELLED + restock, wallet-paid RTS → REFUNDED + wallet credit + restock, RTS still blocked before attempts are exhausted
- [x] This file kept current

## 12. v1.4 — Driver COD remittance via points

Drivers no longer need to travel to Hezalli's office to hand in COD cash:
the counter of any active point can take it. One operator action moves the
money between the two ledgers atomically:

- Courier ledger: `REMITTANCE` (−amount, recorded by the point operator,
  note names the point) — the driver's cash-on-hand drops immediately.
- Point ledger (cash side): new `DRIVER_CASH_IN` (+amount) — the point now
  holds that cash for Hezalli alongside its counter-pickup COD, settled by
  the same admin `COD_REMITTANCE` flow.
- Guard: the amount may not exceed the driver's current cash-on-hand
  (`overRemit`), and only active couriers qualify. The driver is notified.

### Build checklist (v1.4)

- [x] `PointLedgerType.DRIVER_CASH_IN` + migration; cash-side sums updated (`pointLedgerSummary`)
- [x] Action `pointDriverCashIn(driverId, amount, note?)` — atomic double entry + audit + driver notification
- [x] Point ledger page: cash-in form (driver picker + amount)
- [x] Labels in point + admin ledgers; i18n (en + ar)
- [x] Integration tests: cash-in moves both ledgers, over-remit rejected, non-courier rejected
- [x] Tidy: unused `ownerId` lint warning in `point-capacity.test.ts`
- [x] This file kept current

## 14. v1.5 — Inter-point line-haul (two-hop routing)

A seller in Sanaa serving a buyer in Aden no longer needs to reach the Aden
point themselves: they drop the parcel at an **origin point** near them, a
courier carries it city-to-city, and the **destination point** runs the last
mile (driver delivery or buyer pickup) exactly as before. Reuses existing
statuses — no enum churn:

```
Seller ships: origin point (near seller, optional) + destination point
        ↓  LABEL_CREATED
Origin receives [scan]        →  AT_POINT   (at origin; no last-mile assign)
Origin hands to line-haul driver [scan]  →  IN_TRANSIT (custody: driver)
Destination receives [scan]   →  AT_POINT  (at destination; normal flow resumes:
                                  courier auto-assign, or ready-for-pickup)
```

Rules: the origin leg is only offered when origin ≠ destination; both scans
use the same receive/handover modes — the scanning point's role (origin vs
destination) decides the transition; the line-haul driver earns the normal
delivery fee only on final delivery (transfer legs are salaried line-haul
ops, no per-drop fee); both points earn their handling fee split? No — only
the destination point earns `point_handling_fee` on delivery (v1 keeps one
fee; origin compensation via `ADJUSTMENT` until a dedicated fee exists).

### Build checklist (v1.5)

- [x] `Shipment.originPointId` + migration; origin load counts toward the origin point's capacity
- [x] `point-core`: origin receive (`AT_POINT`, no auto-assign), transfer handover (→ `IN_TRANSIT`), destination receive (`IN_TRANSIT` → `AT_POINT`, auto-assign/ready)
- [x] Seller ship form: optional origin-point picker (sorted near the seller) when a destination point/pickup is set
- [x] Point dashboard: transfer parcels visible at both ends (inbound / outbound)
- [x] i18n (en + ar) + integration tests (two-hop happy path incl. pickup orders, wrong-point scans rejected, capacity counts origin leg)
- [x] This file kept current

## 16. v1.6 — Origin transfer fee & stale-parcel visibility

Two finishing touches for a healthy network:

1. **Origin hubs get paid.** A two-hop parcel now credits BOTH ledgers when
   it is finally delivered: the destination point earns `point_handling_fee`
   as before, and the origin point earns the new `point_transfer_fee`
   (default 0.25 USD) — recorded in the same delivery transaction, labelled
   as a transfer leg. No more unpaid work at entry hubs.
2. **Stuck parcels become visible.** A parcel that hasn't moved for
   `stale_parcel_days` (default 3) shows an aged badge ("5d") on the point
   dashboard, and the admin network list shows a red stale-count chip per
   point, so ops can chase the exact hub that's sitting on parcels.

### Build checklist (v1.6)

- [x] Settings: `point_transfer_fee` (default 0.25), `stale_parcel_days` (default 3) + admin form fields
- [x] `shipment-core`: credit the origin point's transfer fee on DELIVERED (same tx as the handling fee)
- [x] Point dashboard: days-held age chip per parcel, amber past the threshold
- [x] Admin points list: stale-parcel count chip per point
- [x] i18n (en + ar) + integration test (two-hop delivery credits both ledgers; single-hop credits one)
- [x] This file kept current

## 18. v1.7 — Delivery network analytics

The admin Reports page (date-ranged) gains a **Delivery network** section so
ops can see how the network performs, not just what it owes:

- Headlines for the selected range: parcels shipped, delivered, failed
  attempts, returned-to-seller, **success rate** (delivered vs RTS), average
  ship→deliver time, and the pickup share of deliveries.
- A per-hub table (top by volume): delivered parcels and fees earned in the
  range — the same numbers a hub's operator sees on their own ledger.

### Build checklist (v1.7)

- [x] `lib/point-stats.ts`: `networkSummary(from, to)` — aggregates over shipments, attempts, events, and the point ledger
- [x] Reports page: Delivery network section reusing the existing date range
- [x] i18n (en + ar)
- [x] Integration test: a delivered + an RTS parcel in range produce the expected headline numbers and per-hub rows
- [x] This file kept current

## 20. v1.8 — Pickup window & stale-parcel sweep

v1.6 made stuck parcels *visible*; v1.8 makes the network *act* on them,
the way Shopee/Lazada PUDO networks do. Notifications only — no automatic
money movement: the operator's RTS scan (§10) stays the single human-verified
trigger for refunds/cancellation, so the sweep can never move cash on its own.

1. **Pickup window.** New setting `pickup_window_days` (default 7): how long
   a PUDO parcel waits at the counter before it should go back to the seller.
2. **Buyer reminder.** A pickup parcel sitting `stale_parcel_days` without
   being collected reminds the buyer once ("your parcel is waiting at
   <hub>").
3. **Window expiry.** Past `pickup_window_days`, the buyer is told the window
   lapsed and the point operator + seller are prompted to run the normal RTS
   scan — which already resolves money (refund / cancel / restock, §10).
4. **Stuck courier parcels.** A courier-routed parcel held at a hub past
   `stale_parcel_days` notifies the operator once to move it.

Mechanics: staleness = `Shipment.updatedAt` age (same signal as the v1.6
badges). One-shot guards are two new nullable timestamps on `Shipment`
(`pickupRemindedAt`, `staleFlaggedAt`) so re-running the sweep is harmless.
Runs from a new `CRON_SECRET`-protected endpoint `/api/cron/points`,
alongside the existing auto-complete/marketing crons.

### Build checklist (v1.8)

- [x] Setting `pickup_window_days` (default 7) + admin form field
- [x] Migration: `Shipment.pickupRemindedAt` / `staleFlaggedAt` (nullable timestamps)
- [x] `lib/point-sweep.ts`: `sweepPointParcels()` → `{reminded, expired, flagged}` with one-shot guards
- [x] `/api/cron/points` route (CRON_SECRET, GET+POST) running the sweep
- [x] i18n (en + ar) for the new notifications + settings label
- [x] Integration test: backdated parcels trigger reminder → expiry → operator flag exactly once; second sweep is a no-op
- [x] This file kept current

## 22. v1.9 — Point payout requests

Completes the "both win" money loop. Hubs earn handling/transfer fees on
their ledger, but getting paid is admin-initiated today — the operator has
no way to ask. v1.9 mirrors the seller payout flow for point operators:

1. **Operator requests.** On the hub's ledger page: request a payout of the
   free earnings balance (or a chosen amount). Guards mirror sellers':
   at least `min_payout_usd`, at most the free balance (earnings minus
   outstanding requests), computed under a row lock on the point so racing
   requests can't overdraw, and only one open request at a time.
2. **Admin resolves.** The admin hub page lists requests; marking one PAID
   flips it race-safely (conditional update) and writes the negative
   `PAYOUT` ledger entry in the same transaction — the request and the
   ledger can never disagree. Rejecting records a reason. Both notify the
   operator (ar/en) and are audit-logged.

Data: new `PointPayoutRequest` (pointId, amountUsd, status reusing
`PayoutStatus`, note, processedBy/At). Cash-side COD remittance stays a
manual admin entry (§12) — this flow only pays out the earnings side.

### Build checklist (v1.9)

- [x] `PointPayoutRequest` model + migration (status reuses `PayoutStatus`)
- [x] `lib/actions/point-payout.ts`: `requestPointPayout` (locked free-balance check, one open request), `markPointPayoutPaid` (flip + PAYOUT ledger row in one tx), `rejectPointPayout`
- [x] Point ledger page: free balance, request form, request history
- [x] Admin hub page: pending requests with pay (reference) / reject (reason)
- [x] i18n (en + ar) + notifications to the operator
- [x] Integration test: below-min / over-balance / double request rejected; pay writes exactly one ledger row and can't double-pay; reject has no ledger effect
- [x] This file kept current

## 24. v1.10 — Buyer-facing network visibility

The network works, but buyers can't _see_ it. Two public-facing pieces:

1. **Pickup card on the public track page.** A pickup parcel held at a hub
   (`AT_POINT` + `PICKUP`) shows a "ready for collection" card: hub name,
   address, phone, and a reminder to bring the delivery code — instead of a
   courier delivery estimate that doesn't apply. Privacy-safe: the hub is a
   public business location; no buyer data is added.
2. **Public points directory** at `/points` (shop layout): ACTIVE hubs
   grouped by governorate with name, city, address, and phone, plus a
   "become a Hezalli Point" link to the existing `/point-partner` page.
   Linked from the checkout pickup picker ("see all points"). Grows both
   sides of the marketplace: buyers discover pickup, partners discover the
   program.

### Build checklist (v1.10)

- [x] `lib/point-public.ts`: `publicPointsByGovernorate()` (ACTIVE only) + `heldAtPoint(shipment)` hub lookup for the track page
- [x] Track page: pickup-ready card (hub name / address / phone + bring-your-code hint); no courier ETA for pickup parcels
- [x] `/points` public directory page + link from checkout picker
- [x] i18n (en + ar) + SEO metadata for `/points`
- [x] Integration test: directory lists only ACTIVE hubs grouped by governorate; held pickup parcel resolves its hub info
- [x] This file kept current

## 26. v1.11 — Driver collection manifest

Closes the last gap to the original vision (§1): _"the driver shows their
collecting QR, the point sees the orders assigned to them and hands them
over"_. Today the counter scans the driver's QR to pick the driver but still
scans every parcel label one by one. v1.11 adds the batch:

1. **Manifest.** Scanning a driver's QR (or picking them) shows every parcel
   at THIS hub assigned to that driver — tracking, destination city, COD
   badge — the driver's pickup list, exactly like big-carrier manifests.
2. **Hand over all.** One tap hands the whole manifest to the driver. Under
   the hood each parcel still goes through the same race-guarded
   `handoverParcelToDriver` transition (events, custody stamps, mismatch
   guards) — the batch is a loop, not a new money/custody path. Per-parcel
   scanning stays available for partial collections.
3. **Result feedback.** The counter sees "N handed, M failed" — a parcel
   grabbed by a concurrent scan just drops out of the batch.

### Build checklist (v1.11)

- [x] `point-core`: `driverManifestAtPoint(pointId, driverId)` (held, assigned, last-mile only) + `handoverManifestToDriver` batch loop
- [x] Actions: `pointDriverManifest` / `pointHandoverManifest` (operator-gated)
- [x] Scan station: manifest panel when a driver is selected (list + "hand over all (N)"), per-parcel scan unchanged
- [x] i18n (en + ar)
- [x] Integration test: manifest lists only this hub's assigned last-mile parcels; batch hands all; concurrent claim drops out; pickup parcels never appear
- [x] This file kept current

## 28. v1.12 — Hub monthly statement

What every real partner network mails its hubs: a monthly statement.
Operators see their ledger as a running list today, but reconciling a month
("what did I earn, what was I paid, how much cash did I owe?") means adding
rows by hand. v1.12 gives them the accounting view:

1. **Statement page** (`/point/statement?month=YYYY-MM`, prev/next nav):
   for the chosen month, BOTH sides of the hub's books —
   - _Earnings_: opening balance → fees earned, payouts, adjustments →
     closing balance.
   - _COD cash_: opening balance → counter COD taken, driver cash-in,
     remittances → closing balance.
   - The full entry list for the month underneath.
2. **CSV export**: a `text/csv` download of the month's entries (date, type,
   note, amount) from an operator-gated route — for spreadsheets, audits, or
   the accountant.

Math note: opening = signed sum of all entries strictly before the month;
closing = opening + the month's delta. Because every ledger row is signed
and immutable, both are pure SUMs — nothing stored, nothing to drift.

### Build checklist (v1.12)

- [x] `lib/point-statement.ts`: `pointStatement(pointId, from, to)` — opening/delta/closing per side + per-type totals + entries

## 30. v1.13 — Courier ledger & monthly statement

The v1.12 statement, for the OTHER cash-handling role. Drivers see two
headline tiles (cash to remit, earnings) but not the entries behind them —
they can't answer "which parcels am I carrying cash for?" or reconcile a
month the way hubs now can.

1. **Driver ledger page** (`/driver/ledger`): the same headline tiles plus
   the recent entry list (COD collected per drop, remittances, delivery-fee
   earnings, payouts, adjustments).
2. **Driver monthly statement** (`/driver/statement?month=YYYY-MM`):
   opening → month's activity → closing for both sides — _earnings_
   (EARNING / PAYOUT / ADJUSTMENT) and _COD cash_ (COD_COLLECTED /
   REMITTANCE) — plus a CSV export, reusing v1.12's `monthRange` /
   `statementCsv` and the same pure-SUM math over the immutable
   `CourierLedgerEntry` table.
3. Linked from the driver home's cash tiles. Gated by `requireCourierId`.

## 32. v1.14 — COD credit control

The standard playbook of Shopee/J&T/Lazada, adapted: **nobody may hold more
of Hezalli's cash than the future income they'd lose by keeping it.** A
driver's future income is new assignments and accrued delivery fees; a
point's is parcel flow and handling-fee payouts. All rules are pure reads
over the existing immutable ledgers (`lib/cod-guard.ts`) — no new tables.

Three platform settings (Admin → Settings; 0 turns a check off):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `driver_cash_limit` | `50` | USD of unremitted COD a driver may hold before auto-assignment skips them. |
| `driver_cod_max_age_hours` | `24` | How long a driver may sit on ANY collected COD. Remittances settle the oldest cash first (FIFO), so partial hand-ins don't reset the clock. |
| `point_cash_limit` | `200` | USD of unremitted cash (counter COD + driver cash-ins) a point may hold before it stops receiving new routing and driver cash-ins. |

Rules:

- **Driver assignment gate** — `courier-assign` filters blocked drivers out
  of every automatic pick (auto/bulk/nearest). Manual dispatch still works —
  ops can override. The driver home shows a red "new deliveries paused"
  banner with the reason and the fix (hand cash in at any point / office),
  and an amber warning from 80% of the cash limit.
- **Earnings are collateral** — `recordEarningsPayout` refuses while the
  driver holds any COD cash; the admin courier page gains a one-click
  "Settle COD from earnings" offset: one atomic double entry
  (REMITTANCE −m, PAYOUT −m, m = min(cash held, earnings owed)) — the
  industry-standard shortage-from-wages netting, no cash moves.
- **Point routing gate** — `point-select` treats an over-limit point as
  unavailable for NEW routing (picker + server re-check); committed parcels
  and buyer pickups are unaffected. `pointDriverCashIn` refuses at an
  over-limit hub so more of Hezalli's cash can't concentrate there.
- **Point payout withholding** — `requestPointPayout` nets held cash out of
  the payable balance: a hub sitting on $20 of cash can only draw
  fees − $20 until it remits (`cashOutstanding` error explains why).

### Build checklist (v1.14)

- [x] Settings: `driver_cash_limit`, `driver_cod_max_age_hours`, `point_cash_limit` + admin form fields
- [x] `lib/cod-guard.ts`: bulk + single courier checks (FIFO age), bulk point check
- [x] `courier-assign`: blocked drivers excluded from automatic assignment
- [x] Driver home: blocked banner (reason-specific) + near-limit warning
- [x] Admin courier page: blocked badge, offset form; payout guarded by `cashOutstanding`
- [x] `point-select`: over-limit points unroutable; `pointDriverCashIn` refuses (`cashLimit`)
- [x] `requestPointPayout`: held cash withheld from the free balance
- [x] i18n (en + ar) + integration tests (`cod-guard.test.ts`)

## 34. v1.15 — Security deposits & trust-based limits

v1.14's flat cash limits become **per-holder credit**. A deposit is optional
— it's one of three ways a holder earns headroom, and history is another, so
a driver with no money to deposit still grows a limit by delivering well:

```
driver limit = driver_cash_limit                     (base, everyone)
             + security deposit                      (admin-recorded, 1:1)
             + trust bonus                           (from delivery history)
point limit  = point_cash_limit + point deposit      (1:1)
```

The trust bonus: every `trust_step_deliveries` completed deliveries
(EARNING ledger rows) add `trust_step_bonus_usd`, capped at
`trust_bonus_cap_usd` — defaults 20 / $10 / $100, so a driver with 200
clean deliveries carries base + $100 with no deposit at all. The AGE limit
stays fixed for everyone: trusted or not, cash must not sit overnight.

Deposits are plain fields (`User.courierDepositUsd`,
`DeliveryPoint.depositUsd`), not ledger rows — the cash lives outside the
system (office safe / bank), like payout references. Admin-set only via
`lib/actions/deposit.ts` (audited `courier.deposit` / `point.deposit`,
holder notified). Zero is valid; the amount REPLACES the stored balance.

UI: the admin courier page shows the full breakdown (base + deposit +
trust = personal limit) beside the deposit form; the admin point page the
same; the driver home cash tile shows "your cash limit: $X — it grows with
every delivery" so the incentive is visible.

## 36. v1.16 — Wallet COD hold (pledged collateral)

The third leg of the credit limit: a courier voluntarily locks part of
their HezalliPay balance as collateral (`Wallet.codHoldUsd`) — no money
moves, it just stops being spendable, and the limit rises by
`min(codHoldUsd, availableUsd)` (an unbacked pledge is worth nothing, which
also makes any race between a pledge and a concurrent spend harmless).

```
driver limit = base + deposit + wallet hold + trust bonus
```

Rules:

- **Pledge is self-service** (`lib/actions/wallet-hold.ts`, driver ledger
  page): raising it only needs the balance to cover the new hold (guarded
  conditional update). **Releasing it requires empty pockets** — while the
  driver holds any COD cash the pledge is locked, so the collateral can't
  vanish exactly when it matters. Audited (`courier.walletHold`).
- **Held money can't leave.** All four wallet outflow paths (withdrawal,
  P2P/pay-user transfer, bill/airtime, pay-order-with-balance) now require
  `availableUsd ≥ amount + codHoldUsd` in both the pre-check and the atomic
  debit guard.
- The admin courier page breakdown and the driver ledger card show the
  pledge; the driver sees balance / pledged / resulting limit in one line.

### Build checklist (v1.16)

- [x] Schema + migration: `Wallet.codHoldUsd` (Decimal, default 0)
- [x] Outflow guards respect the hold: withdrawal, transfers, bills, order pay-with-balance
- [x] `lib/cod-guard.ts`: effective collateral = min(hold, balance) added to the driver limit
- [x] `lib/actions/wallet-hold.ts`: self-service pledge (raise = balance-guarded; release = only with no COD cash)
- [x] Driver ledger: pledge card; admin courier page: hold in the limit breakdown
- [x] i18n (en + ar) + integration tests (pledge raises limit, unfunded pledge rejected, pledged money can't transfer out, release requires empty pockets)
